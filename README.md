Upset
=====

This is a fork of upset, an UPS patcher which has been lost in the depths
of the internet.

A command line interface has been added.

It's not clear to me what the license for the original upset is.
In nall's Makefile it says "license: public domain", though, so I
can assume that to apply over upset too.

My changes, that is the command line interface, are under the GPLv3.
